simpler version of horizon chart for terminal, for now just for apple M1/M2 SoC 

Just prints things to stdout, refreshes every second, monitors:
1. CPU util
2. GPU util
3. ANE util (or, more precisely, power consumtion)
4. disk io
5. network io

next:
1. can add frequencies
2. make more interactive, show values
3. figure out what 'ane power consumption' is
